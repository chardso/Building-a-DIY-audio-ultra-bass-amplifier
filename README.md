# Building-a-DIY-audio-ultra-bass-amplifier

DIY audio means "do it yourself"rather than buying apiece of possibly expensive audio equipment such as a high-end audio amplifier or speaker.

The person practicing DIY audio will make it by him/herself

# step by step procedure of building an ultra bass amplifier. 

## experiment one
- Tie the transistor TDA 2030 on the alluminium piece.

- Spray it's terminals left and right and apply soldering wire on each terminal.

- solder the diode 1N4148 with the negative on the second terminal of the TDA 2030 and the positive on the second terminal from the right,same procedure repeated for second diode.

- solder a resistor 47k on the second terminal of TDA2030 and same applies to the second TDA2030 on the right

- speaker ðŸ”Š negative soldered on the negative on the negative of the 3A diode and the positive on the second terminal of the TDA2030 when the experiment is turned upside down from your left on the same point where the positive of the diode 1N4148 is soldered
