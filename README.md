# Building-a-DIY-audio-ultra-bass-amplifier

DIY audio means "do it yourself"rather than buying apiece of possibly expensive audio equipment such as a high-end audio amplifier or speaker.

The person practicing DIY audio will make it by him/herself

# step by step procedure of building an ultra bass amplifier. 

## experiment one
- Tie the transistor TDA 2030 on the alluminium piece.

- Spray it's terminals left and right and apply soldering wire on each terminal.

- solder the diode 1N4148 with the negative on the second terminal of the TDA 2030 and the positive on the second terminal from the right,same procedure repeated for second diode.

- solder a resistor 47k on the second terminal of TDA2030 and same applies to the second TDA2030 on the right

- solder capacitor 2A104j,one on the second terminal of TDA2030 from the right and the other on the second terminal of TDA2030 also from the right

- solder resistor 100k,one on the the first terminal of the first TDA2030 and the other one on the first terminal of TDA2030 from the left

- solder capacitor 50v,0.1uf,the negative soldered on the second terminal of TDA2030 and the second one also the negative soldered on the second terminal of the TDA2030 from the left

- 100ohm resistors,one soldered on the positive of the capacitor 50v,0.1uf and the second one on the first 2A104j capacitor

- 470ohm resistors,one soldered on the positive of the capacitor 50v,0.1uf and the second one one the 2A104j capacitor

- jumper wire or copper wire soldered on all resistors.

- The overlapping terminals and copper wire are cut to obtain a uniform level

- Diode 3A,the negative soldered on the positive of the diode 1N4148 and the positive soldered on the negative of the second diode 1N4148.
