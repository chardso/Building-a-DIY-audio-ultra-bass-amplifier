<h1>building a diy audio ultra bass amplifier</h1>

<Paragraph>The project consists of two experiements;
<li>
using two transistors TDA 2030
</li>
<li>
using one transistor TDA 2030
</li>




<h2>
Step by step procedure for experiment using two TDA 2030 transistors
</h2>

<li>
Tie the transistor TDA 2030 on the alluminium piece.
</li>

<li>
Spray it's terminals left and right and apply soldering wire on each terminal.
</li>

<li>
solder the diode 1N4148 with the negative on the second terminal of the TDA 2030 and the positive on the second terminal from the right,same procedure repeated for second diode.

<li>
solder a resistor 47k on the second terminal of TDA2030 and same applies to the second TDA2030 on the right

<li>
solder capacitor 2A104j,one on the second terminal of TDA2030 from the right and the other on the second terminal of TDA2030 also from the right

<li>
solder resistor 100k,one on the the first terminal of the first TDA2030 and the other one on the first terminal of TDA2030 from the left

<li>
solder capacitor 50v,0.1uf,the negative soldered on the second terminal of TDA2030 and the second one also the negative soldered on the second terminal of the TDA2030 from the left
