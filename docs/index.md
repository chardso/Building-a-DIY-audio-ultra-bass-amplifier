<h1>building a DIY audio ultra bass amplifier</h1>
The project consists of two experiements;

<li>
using two transistors TDA 2030

<li>
using one transistor TDA 2030

<h2>
Step by step procedure for experiments

<h3>
Using two TDA2030 transistors
</h3>


<li>
Tie the transistor TDA 2030 on the alluminium piece.

<li>
Spray it's terminals left and right and apply soldering wire on each terminal.

<li>
solder the diode 1N4148 with the negative on the second terminal of the TDA 2030 and the positive on the second terminal from the right,same procedure repeated for second diode.

<li>
The second copper wire soldered on the first terminal of the TDA2030 from the left and the other terminal on the first terminal of the second TDA2030
<li>    
104j,630v capacitors,one soldered on the first terminal of TDA2030and second terminal soldered on the neutral terminal where the coper wire is soldered.the second 104j,630v capacitor soldered on the terminal of 2A104j capacitor and resistor 470ohms and the second terminal on the first terminal of the TDA2030 where the copper wire is soldered
<img src="104j630v.png"/>
<li>   
The third copper wire soldered on the neutral terminal of TDA2030 and the second terminal on the neutral terminal of the second TDA2030

<li>   
270ohm resistor soldered on the positive of the capacitor 50v,0.1uf and the other terminal on the 2A104j,first capacitor from the left.
<img src="270ohmresistor.png"/>
<li>   
capacitor 25v,47uf ,the negative soldered on the jumper wire and the experiment is turned upside and the positive is left hanging

<li>   
2A102j capacitor,one terminal soldered on there side of the copper wire and the other terminal left hanging in air
<img src="2A102jcapacitor.png"/>

<li>   
Another copper wire soldered on the hanging terminal of 2A102j capacitor and the other terminal on the second of the first TDA2030 on the second terminal from the right when the experiment is turned upside down
<li>    
cross check the contacts that may lead to short circuit
<img src="crosscheck.png"/>
<li>    
audio line,the positive are combined together and negative also combined
<img src="positiveconegco.png"/>

<li>    
the positives are soldered on the first terminal of the TDA2030 where the 104j,630v capacitor is soldered and the negatives on the copper wire where the 2A102j capacitor is soldered
<img src="solderaudioline.png"/>
<li>
power line, negative on the second copper wire on the TDA2030 when ur expriement is upright and the positive on the first copper wire on the first terminal of the TDA2030 on ur right
<img src="powerline.png"/>
<img src="connectpowersce.png"/>
<li>   
speaker loud_sound negative soldered on the negative on the negative of the 3A diode and the positive on the second terminal of the TDA2030 when the experiment is turned upside down from your left on the same point where the positive of the diode 1N4148 is soldered
<img src="speakersolder1.png"/>  
<li>  
check for contact joints before connecting to a 12v,7AH power
<img src="crosscheck.png"/>
<img src="speakersolder2.png"/>
<li>   
provide an audio source for example phone or any other audio system that uses a big pin.
<img src="connectpowersce.png"/>
<li>
then insert the audio line into the audio source,then play music, enjoy your ultra bass amplifier
